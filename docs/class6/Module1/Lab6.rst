Lab 6: Validating, Testing & Troubleshooting HA Group Functionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have succesfully configured HA Groups we will perform a series of validation tests as well as provide tips for troubleshooting


Disable an interface to force HA Group actions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this task we will: 

* manipulate an interface on the active BIG-IP.   
* disable an interface and observe BIG-IP behavior during failover
* monitor logs to review the failover process.


On the active BIG-IP: 

* Navigate to Network, Interfaces, and place  checkmark next to interface 1.1 then click on the **Disable** button.

* During this time observe the BIG-IP status in the upper-left corner of each BIG-IP.  Did a failover event occur and did state change?

  .. image:: ../images/image102.png

  Observe the log messages from each BIG-IP.  Previously, BIG-IP A was the Standby device.   Conversely, BIG-IP B was previously the Active
      device.

We will now re-enable Interface 1.1 on the Standby BIG-IP by performing the following step.

In the standby BIG-IP

*  Navigate to Network, Interfaces, Interface List, and place  checkmark next to interface 1.1 then click the **Enable** button.

#. Did a failover event occur?   If so, why or why not?

This concludes the **BIG-IP HA Failover - Do it the Proper Way** lab.

**ADD**
- timing / log events of HA Group failover vs. traditonal 
- HA scoring . . . what is contributing to the Score, and how it affects the failover
- show any mirroring / persistence info from the VS (stats, etc.)?
- t'shooting tips / tricks / steps . . . DSC config guide walk-through as an idea

**NOTE**:
   Ports	Device group members should be able to communicate over ports 443, 4353, 1026 (UDP), and 22 (recommended).
   BIG-IP ASM requires the following additional Policy Sync TCP ports: 6123-6128

**Appendix:**

   â€¢	tmsh commands cheat sheet:

   Task 1:	Create BIG-IP Trunks

   tmsh create net trunk int_trunk interfaces add { 1.1 }
   tmsh create net trunk ext_trunk interfaces add { 1.2 }
   tmsh create net trunk HA_trunk interfaces add { 1.3 }


   Task 2:	Create BIG-IP VLANs

   tmsh create net vlan int_vlan_10 tag 10 interfaces add { int_trunk }
   tmsh create net vlan ext_vlan_20 tag 20 interfaces add { ext_trunk }
   tmsh create net vlan HA_vlan_30 tag 30 interfaces add { HA_trunk }


   Task 3:	Create BIG-IP Self IPs

   tmsh create net self self_vlan10 address 10.1.10.242/24 vlan int_vlan_10
   tmsh create net self self_vlan20 address 10.1.20.242/24 vlan ext_vlan_20
   tmsh create net self self_ha_vlan30 address 10.1.30.242/24 vlan HA_vlan_30


   Task 4:	Define Device Service Cluster High-Availability Settings


   tmsh modify cm device bigip1 configsync-ip 10.1.30.242
   tmsh modify cm device bigip1 unicast-address { { ip 10.1.10.242 } { ip 10.1.20.242 } }
