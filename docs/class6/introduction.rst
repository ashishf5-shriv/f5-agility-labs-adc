**Welcome to the BIG-IP HA Failover with HA Groups Lab**

Lab Description

Explore additional Application Deliver Controller (ADC) High-Availability (HA) enhancements to create a highly resilient failover environment.  This lab will demonstrate how additional Device Management configuration objects can create a quicker failover mechanism between an Active/Standby BIG-IP pair.
 
  **During this hands-on lab, you will learn the following:**
  
•	How to establish a successful device-trust between BIG-IPs
•	Understand log messaging as it relates to failover scenarios
•	How to create an HA Group, and respective Configuration Objects
•	How to leverage the construct of HA Groups vs. Preferred Order for High-Availability Failover
•	Understand how the HA Group Objects affect the overall HA Score
